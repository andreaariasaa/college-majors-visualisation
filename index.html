                <h1>Understanding Paths to Migration</h1>

                  To be a migrant is to have your life and your story politicized. Fleeing violence or natural disasters, seeking economic opportunities, or moving for a new job in a foreign country becomes a political act rather than a personal one. Over the past decade the number of migrants from Central America to the United States has been steadily increasing and unfortunately, prejudice against migrants and fears over “caravans” of migrants have been increasing alongside. But who are the migrants? What are their stories? <br><br>

                <h2>All household respondents</h2>
                <p>Our data comes from a survey of around 5000 households in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Many of the respondents have family members who have migrated, considered migrating, or previously attempted to migrate, but many do not. For those who did consider or previously migrated, 83.4% of respondents said their primary motivation was to find better job opportunities. Let’s begin by understanding the current economic opportunities for the households surveyed.

                <h2>Which of these statements is closest to how you feel about your household income these days?</h2>
                <p>We can see here the rough make up of the income brackets from our respondents. We will spend the rest of this visualisation focused on the families with the least resources
                who answered "we are in a very critical situation with our current income."</p>

                <p>
                    There are a variety of factors that impact household experiences and decisions to migrate. Looking just at the households
                    at the lowest income level, we can now split by perceived level of violence.

                <h2>Ideally, if you had the opportunity, would you like to move permanently or for a long period to another country?</h2>
                <p>The number of families seeking to migrate may make sense given the story that is always told of migrants fleeing a lack of economic opportunity, though the reality is often that many people at this level of instability cannot afford migration. The average cost in USD for those who have attempted to migrate or have family members who have, was around $6000. </p>

              <h2>Are you planning to move to another country in the next 12 months?</h2>
              <p>Let’s look at the families who want to migrate and see if they are actually able to. Though not all the families answered this question, we can see that desires don’t always match up with reality. Migrating isn’t as simple as news pundits bemoaning the onslaught of migrants would have viewers believe.</p>

            <section class="step">
              <h2>Are you planning to move to another country in the next 12 months?</h2>
                <p>Of the families who want to migrate but are not planning on migrating, there are a variety of stated reasons, the most
                common being not having enough money to pay for the transfer or to pay for housing in another country.</p>

                <h1>Conclusions</h1>
                <p>
                  Here we can get a sense for how lower income households fair, and see how the perceived level of violence in their areas,
                  and understand why someone may want to migrate and why they may not be able to.


                  We can start to understand these stories as more than dots or more than political controversy in the US. Every dot here is a household with a story and life and we hope to shed a little light on that story.
